# I want a career in the cloud!

Great!  Welcome to the FAQ!  This page should serve as your first stop in getting started with your cloud career.  We'll go over what your expectations should be and what obstacles you'll face.

# Where do I even begin?

Start with this!

 You don't need to watch the video but this post really helps understand why this isn't an entry level field and helps set expectations moving forward.  There's a loose plan in there that you're recommended to start with.  As you learn more and your circumstances change, you can adjust your plan.  For example, if you're not completely new to tech, you can skip getting the CCP.  Refer [here](certification.md) to see why.

 You also need to have this bookmarked.  This is a roadmap that represents all the concepts and skills you need to have a decent handle on before you can really jump in

 Keep in mind, none of this is meant to overwhelm or discourage you.  In fact, you should be encouraged by all the cool stuff you get to learn!  But you have a long road ahead of you and it helps to know what's expected.  

 # What certification do I need to get to get a cloud job?

 None.  You really need to look at the resources linked above.  No certification alone helps you get a job (And anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell you something). We have a more detailed section written up [on the certification section.](certification.md)

# How do I DevOps?

This would take more explanation than an FAQ should try to accomplish.  If you haven't really had any exposure to DevOps or Agile or really any professional software deployment environment, you might enjoy reading [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B078Y98RG8/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=).

It's written as a novel and walks you through the ideology and what problems it solves.  It is a bit dated on some things but the core concept holds up today.  

Note:  Sometimes this book is free for kindle.  Keep an eye out if that's important to you.  Alternatively, as it's been out for a while, you might be able to borrow it from your local library or purchase from a discount book store.  

 # I really just need some experience or a personal project I can sink my teeth into

We recommend everyone trying to get into cloud to complete the Cloud Resume Challenge.

 The cloud resume challenge is a good beginner project.  It has you working with different tools across AWS as well as coding and a bit of web development.  It's a decent conversation topic during interviews too.
